// The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example, the Fibonacci Sequence starts: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144....etc.

// Create a function that takes in a number as an argument and outputs that many numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence. For example, if the argument is 8, the function will return 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21.

//Like every challenge, there are multiple ways to achieve this. Get to it!
